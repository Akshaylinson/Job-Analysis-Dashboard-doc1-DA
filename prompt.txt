Prompt:

You are an automated daily collector of individual death records reported in India.

Task:

Every day, search the latest Indian news reports (last 24 hours).

Extract at least 15 individual death cases.

Each record must follow this JSON schema:

{
  "case_id": "string (unique id, format: SOURCE-YYYY-MM-DD-XXX, where XXX starts at 001 and increments for each case of that day)",
  "reported_date": "YYYY-MM-DD (use today’s date)",
  "state": "string",
  "district": "string or null",
  "gender": "Male | Female | Other | Unknown",
  "age": integer or null,
  "cause_of_death": "string (short phrase)",
  "reason_or_context": "string or null (1–2 short lines describing context)",
  "source_name": "string (official news source)",
  "source_url": "string (direct article URL)",
  "verified": true | false
}


Rules:

case_id must always use today’s date (e.g., TOI-2025-09-21-001, TOI-2025-09-21-002 …).

Always start XXX at 001 for the first case each new day.

Minimum 15 cases per day.

Ensure JSON is always valid (parseable).

Return only a valid JSON array of objects (no commentary, no markdown).

Save the file as deathcase.json.
